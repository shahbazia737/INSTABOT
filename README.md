# INSTABOT
- Python v3.6 or greater
- Pip v18 or greater

## Install

**Recommended: From PyPi:** (Stable)

- `python3 -m pip install instabot-py`
## Quick Start

- **Make sure you have Python 3.6 or above installed**

  - `python3 --version`

On Windows you might have to use `python` without the version (`3`) suffix. Experienced users should use virtualenv.

- **If your version is below 3.6, we recommend you install the latest Python 3.7**

  - [Python on Windows](https://github.com/instabot-py/instabot.py/wiki/Installing-Python-on-Windows)
  - [Python on Mac](https://github.com/instabot-py/instabot.py/wiki/Installing-Python-3.7-on-macOS)
  - [Python on Raspberry Raspbian / Debian / Ubuntu](https://github.com/instabot-py/instabot.py/wiki/Installing-Python-3.7-on-Raspberry-Pi)

- **Install instabot.py from PyPi repository**

  - `python3 -m pip install instabot-py`

- **Start the bot** üèÅ

  - `instabot-py`
  - or `python3 -m instabot_py`
  - For more advanced parameters and configurations download and edit [example.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/instabot-py/instabot.py/master/example.py) and run `python3 example.py`

- **Config** ‚öôÔ∏è

When you first run `instabot-py` a file called `config.ini` will be created in your current directory, along with an SQLite DB, and an error.log.

After the initial configuration, you can manually edit `config.ini` with a text editor. Restart the bot for changes to take effect.

The `%username%.db` file contains a record of the posts the bot has liked, and the users it has followed/unfollowed.

The `%username%.session` file stores your session with Instagram to avoid re-logins each time you start the bot.

<!-- ## Usage examples
Basic bot implementation:
```py
bot = InstaBot('login', 'password')
bot.auto_mod()
```

Standard use with custom tags:
```py
bot = InstaBot('login', 'password', tag_list=['with', 'your', 'tag'])
bot.auto_mod()
```

Standard use with change default settings (you should know what you do!):
```py
bot = InstaBot('login', 'password',
               like_per_day=1000,
               media_max_like=50,
               media_min_like=5,
               tag_list=['like', 'follow', 'f4f'],
               max_like_for_one_tag=50,
               log_mod=1)
bot.auto_mod()
```

Get media by one tag `'python'` and like 4 of them:
```py
bot = InstaBot('login', 'password')
bot.get_media_id_by_tag('python')
bot.like_all_exist_media(4)
```
